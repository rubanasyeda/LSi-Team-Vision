# LSi-Team-Vision
Use AI to forecast when shelters will experience high demand, allowing for better resource allocation, with a focus on predicting the number of beds required.

## Project Scope and Requirements

This project aims to develop an advanced forecasting model to predict shelter demand based on various influencing factors. The key objectives include:

- **Forecasting shelter demand** using historical data, weather patterns, and socio-economic indicators.
- **Providing early warnings** for demand surges to help shelters allocate resources effectively.
- **Developing an automated system** that continuously learns and improves predictions over time.
- **Creating a user-friendly dashboard** for shelters to monitor forecasts, trends, and provide inputs to the model.

## Data Sources

The following datasets were used in this project:

- [Statistics Canada - Table 14-10-0353-01](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=1410035301): Shelter usage data 
- [Government of Canada - Homelessness Data](https://housing-infrastructure.canada.ca/homelessness-sans-abri/reports-rapports/data-shelter-2023-donnees-refuge-eng.html): Shelter data result report 2023
  

## Options for Testing/Validation

To ensure the reliability of the forecasting model, the following testing and validation approaches will be used:

- **Accuracy Measurement**: Compare predicted shelter demand with actual demand to evaluate the model's accuracy.
- **Scenario Testing**: Assess model performance under different conditions, such as extreme weather or seasonal variations.
- **Scalability Analysis**: Test whether the system can be applied to different cities or regions with varying homelessness challenges.
- **Interpretability & Usability**: Ensure stakeholders can easily understand and interpret model predictions and insights.
- **False Prediction Analysis**: Track false positives and negatives (e.g., predicting high demand when it doesn’t occur or missing peak demand).
- **User Feedback & Adoption**: Conduct surveys or interviews with shelter staff and decision-makers to gauge satisfaction with the system’s usability and impact.
